## 📊 Dataset Details  

The dataset consists of **medical and lifestyle-related features** that contribute to diabetes risk.  

| 🔍 **Feature**          | 📖 **Description**                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 🧑‍⚕️ **Age**         | Patient’s age in years                        |
| 🚻 **Gender**         | Categorized as Male, Female, or Other        |
| ⚖️ **BMI**           | Body Mass Index (weight-to-height ratio)      |
| 🩸 **HbA1c Level**   | Average blood sugar over the last 2-3 months  |
| 🩺 **Blood Glucose Level** | Current blood sugar level                  |
| ❤️ **Hypertension**  | 0 = No, 1 = Yes (High blood pressure)         |
| 💓 **Heart Disease** | 0 = No, 1 = Yes (History of heart disease)    |
| 🚬 **Smoking History** | Categorized into different smoking behaviors |

All data was **preprocessed and standardized** before training to ensure **reliable predictions**.
